          The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language
          for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
          assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
          scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML
          documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
          documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a
          web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance

            One way to use media queries is to have an alternate CSS section
            right inside your style sheet. The following example changes the
            background-color to lightgreen if the viewport is 480 pixels wide or
            wider (if the viewport is less than 480 pixels, the background-color
            will be pink)
